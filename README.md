ðŸŽ¯ About Me
-

I'm a passionate and curious software development student currently studying at CodeSpace. My journey into tech began with a fascination for how websites and digital tools work behind the scenes. Over time, I've developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript next,  I'm now focused on building responsive web interfaces and improving my front-end skills.

I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and turning creative ideas into functional web applications. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, contribute to open-source projects, and eventually work on products that make a real impact in peopleâ€™s lives.

Whether it's experimenting with code or collaborating with others, I'm always looking for ways to grow as a developer.
